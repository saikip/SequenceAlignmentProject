# BioInformatics HW 1
Project implements:
1. Simulator for sequence generator 
2. Simulator for sequence partitioning 
3. Sequence assembler

# Instructions
1. To compile java files, open commandprompt (in Windows) or Terminal (in iOS) from the project folder.
2. Type 'javac <java filename>.java' without quotes and hit enter.
3. Repeat step#2 for all java files
4. Type 'java <java filename>' without quotes along with reuired commandline arguments for corresponding java class and hit enter.
  
# Files
1. sequenceGenerator.java - Simulator for sequence generator [All set? Discuss.]
2. sequencePartitioner.java (temporary name) - Simulator for sequence partitioning [Ask NEHA for updates]
3. sequenceAssembler.java - Sequence assembler [complete dp function for getDovetailScore() function]
4. makefile
5. SGoutputfileX - X stands for a number. Output file from Seqeunce Generator. To be used as input file for Sequence Partitioner.
6. SPoutputfileX - X stands for a number. Output file from Sequence Partitioner. To be used as input file for Sequence Assembler.
7. SAoutputfileX - X stands for a number. Output file from Sequence Assembler. Final output file with a single sequence.
